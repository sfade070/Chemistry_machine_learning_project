# Chemistry_machine_learning_project

## Description 
This repository provides an overview of some machine learning techniques that have recently appeared in the computational chemistry literature.  We demonstrate that machine learning can be used to predict the performance of a synthetic reaction in multidimensional  chemical  space  using  data  obtained  via  high-throughput  experimentation.  The natural fit between machine learning and chemistry research leads tothe common utilization of learning algorithms to construct a smart strategy to drive Chemical Reactions to desired outcomes with a minimum cost.  We created scripts to explore the Chemical space of a some defined reaction and we make it available online.
